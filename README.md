## How It Works
### 
- ## Frontend: React (TypeScript), Material-UI, React Router, Context API for state management.
- ## Backend:  Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), RESTful API.
- ## Payment APIs: MTN MoMo & Airtel Money.

### Core Logic
- **Backend:**
  - All attendance, fine, and payment data is persisted in MongoDB.
  - The frontend always fetches the latest data from the backend, ensuring consistency and robustness.
- **Attendance & Fines:**
  - When a citizen is marked "Absent," a fine is automatically created or updated in the backend.
  - When marked "Present," any related fine is deleted.
  - Fine status (Paid/Unpaid) is updated via payment actions and reflected everywhere.
- **Payments:**
  - Citizens can pay fines via integrated payment APIs.
  - Payment initiation triggers a backend API call to MTN/Airtel, and updates fine/payment status on success.
  - Payment history is recorded for each fine.
- **Real-Time Sync:**
  - All updates (attendance, fines, payments) are immediately reflected across all pages and users.
- **Notifications:**
  - Citizens receive browser notifications for upcoming sessions after login.
